ARTS & CULTURE,"Modeling Agencies Enabled Sexual Predators For Years, Former Agent Says","In October 2017, Carolyn Kramer received a disturbing phone call. The former modeling agent listened intently as a model she used to represent told her that a famous French photographer, who still shoots for top publications, raped her when she was 16. Shortly after meeting the man at a restaurant in 1983, the model said she blacked out after drinking one glass of champagne, then woke up in his bed the next morning with a sore and bruised vagina. The woman, who preferred to remain anonymous, confirmed this story with HuffPost, but did not want to name the photographer for fear of legal repercussions. “He was one of the photographers that agents and clients and young girls basically knew was lecherous,” Kramer said, claiming that she and other agents sent their models to him in the '80s anyway. “[But] what I didn't realize [at the time] is that he was raping girls.”  Kramer said she broke down crying after the woman relayed her story of assault. “In that moment I felt that I let down the models who I represented over the course of 20 years,” she said. “It made me feel like, here it is in front of my face now and I didn't do anything to change [it.]” It's been 14 years since Kramer left the fashion business. But throughout the two decades she spent working as a modeling agent in New York City in the 1980s, '90s and early 2000s, Kramer said she knew about rampant sexual misconduct in her industry ― and didn't protect her models from the egregious behavior. Now, amid the domino-like fall of so many high-profile alleged sexual offenders, the 58-year-old can't stop thinking about how she and other agents sent girls, some as young as 13, to modeling gigs with photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators. So in October, the former agent decided to speak out.  “Many of these girls who are assaulted [as models] aren't older than 15 years old,” she wrote in a Facebook post. “And I stand here to say how ashamed I am of myself for not having had the tools or the resources or guts to stop it.” Kramer's peers queued up in the post's comments section to corroborate her story. One of her former colleagues, ex-model Kristen Noel, said her agency, Elite Model Management, sent her to Paris in the early '80s to stay with an agent who repeatedly groped and forcibly kissed her. She was 16. “Elite protected him and disconnected from their responsibility to me,” Noel told HuffPost.  Another commenter, hair and makeup artist Dawn Jacobson, said she saw agencies regularly endanger models when she worked in Milan in the '80s. According to her, companies sent young women to live in residences ― one of which was reportedly known as “Clitoride,” Italian for “clitoris” ― where they were preyed on by wealthy Italian men. “I think the agencies have massive culpability because they don't necessarily care about anything other than who gets the booking,” the 59-year-old, who still works in fashion, told HuffPost. “It becomes a little bit of a human trafficking kind of thing.” Kramer's post, her first public denouncement of the sexual harassment and abuse she'd witnessed and heard about in the fashion industry, clearly struck a nerve. As the #MeToo revolution continues to spark a national dialogue on sexual misconduct, the former agent wants to expose exactly how the very modeling agencies she worked for enabled predators, a disturbing reality that she believes still exists today.  Kramer, a New Jersey native, doesn't seem like the type to stay silent. She has a self-described “big personality” and speaks bluntly with a slight New York accent. In a recent Facebook profile photo, she's wearing a shirt that reads “Fuck Trump” and raising her middle finger. But since she retired from the fashion world in 2004, Kramer said she felt like nobody ― primarily, the media ― was interested in what she had to say.  Only recently, the former agent noted, have news outlets begun systematically covering the kinds of abuse allegations she wants to condemn. It's true that sexual assault accusations made against fashion photographer Terry Richardson date back to 2001, and that he was only officially dropped by certain top magazines and brands in October 2017. (Richardson has long denied any nonconsensual behavior.) And while at least 18 current and former male models recently accused famed photographer Bruce Weber of sexual harassment (Weber has denied these claims), one of whom has filed a lawsuit, industry insiders claim there is a long list of predators who still thrive in a largely unregulated profession that combines young models, big male egos and drugs.  Kramer's story dates back to 1983, when she was hired by the industry's top agency, Elite Model Management, as an assistant booking agent in New York. Her previous fashion industry jobs had been horrible. Kramer once worked with a photographer who she said cornered her in his office and tried to forcibly kiss her. And she worked for Foster-Fell Model Management, which she called a “slimy, horrible” agency.  “The models were basically prostitutes,” she said. ”[The owner] would have parties I would be at with licentious business men who were only there to fuck the models.” (Jeremy Foster-Fell, who co-founded the now-defunct agency in 1970, denied these claims to HuffPost. “To say there was an arrangement of financial exchange and sexual favors would be completely out of whack,” he said, adding, however, that “if you're looking after a whole bunch of good-looking ladies who are running around Manhattan, you're going to be running into trouble here and there sometimes.”)  But at 24, Kramer found herself employed by the modeling world's gold standard, an agency that represented Cindy Crawford and Linda Evangelista, where she didn't expect to encounter abusive men. Her transition to Elite was “like going from community college to Harvard,” she said. Sadly, Kramer's optimism was quickly dashed.  At Elite New York, her job frequently involved booking models on “go-sees,” the name for appointments during which photographers or designers scout new faces for upcoming shoots. In these meetings, vulnerable young women's success often depends on impressing (mostly) powerful men. Kramer said she and other Elite agents would send models, who in many cases were under 16 and had never been to New York City, on appointments with nothing more than subway fare and a map. According to Kramer, the girls mostly went alone, because at the time there were no laws requiring guardians to accompany underage models on shoots. New York passed a bill in 2013 that, among other things, requires models under 16 to have chaperones. But before that, a 2012 study by Model Alliance, an organization that advocates for labor rights in fashion, found that 52 percent of models are rarely or never accompanied by guardians to a shoot, despite the fact that the majority of models start working between age 13 and 16. Kramer quickly learned about the perils of go-sees and photo shoots. Though the former agent says that the models she represented at the time didn't tell her directly about being sexually harassed or assaulted by photographers ― likely, she said, because they were terrified of losing job opportunities ― Kramer soon heard through industry gossip with colleagues who the predators were. “I wouldn't have even called it a secret,” she said. “It was just sort of common hearsay that this list of photographers were pigs...I had to make the appointments with [these men]. It would make me gag, but I had to do my job or I'd be fired.”  Another Elite employee, Marie Anderson Boyd, who was an agent and vice president at the company's Chicago office between 1985 and 1990, said models would regularly tell her about the sexual misconduct they experienced on go-sees. ”[Some photographers] will think nothing of walking over to some teen girl who's brand new to the business, taking her top off, unbuttoning her bra and saying something like,  'I want you to look at me and think of ... giving me oral sex,'” she said. “And a lot of girls have never even done that [before], so they don't even know what the [photographers] mean.”  Anderson Boyd said she never told her managers at Elite about the models' abusive stories, in part because executives like John Casablancas and Gerald Marie also allegedly engaged in misconduct. “They established a culture of compliance with sexually predatory behavior,” she said. “That trickled down into everything everybody did.”  Indeed, during Kramer's first year at Elite, the agency's late founder, the then-41-year-old Casablancas, was having a public affair with an underage model named Stephanie Seymour. Kramer was horrified that Casablancas, with his movie-star good looks and “intoxicating” charisma, was committing statutory rape.  “As a young little upstart, I was very in awe of him,” she said. “But at the same time I'm thinking to myself, Stephanie's supposed to be at a Vogue shooting at 9 a.m. and she's still in bed with John. I thought it was wrong and I honestly couldn't believe it went on. It made me sick.” Other alleged abuses at Elite unfurled from there. Gerald Marie, the head of Elite Paris, was in his 30s when he allegedly raped a 17-year-old model named Carré Otis on multiple occasions, which she detailed in her 2011 memoir. At the time, Otis was temporarily staying with him while she was modeling abroad in the mid-'80s. She didn't feel as though she could tell the agency about the abuse.  “When [Elite] New York said goodbye to me and put me in Gerald's apartment, he was like my new owner,” Otis told HuffPost. “There was no one in New York who created a connection with me and said,  'Hey, here's the way it should go, and if it doesn't go this way, here's a number to call.' It was just really a hand-off.” “There was a below-the-radar understanding that the [executives] of Elite [Casablancas and Marie] were sleeping with young women,” Kramer said. “I'm working at an agency where statutory rape is in front of my face and yet I can't do anything.” Kramer said at 24 she herself was groped by a high-profile agent who went on to become an Elite executive. “I was sitting on his lap and his hands were all over me, coming around [my waist] and trying to grab my breast,” she said. “I didn't react because I was so accustomed to seeing photographers be touchy-feely with models.” Kramer did not tell anyone at Elite about the misconduct, because she said it never occurred to her that such commonplace behavior was worth reporting, never mind addressing. And those who tried to call out problematic behavior didn't get very far. In 2000, Anderson Boyd told New York Magazine that she remembered watching two female executives plead with Marie and Casablancas to stop sleeping with underage women. Anderson Boyd says Marie's response was, “We are men. We have our needs.” “I was grossed out by what was happening,” the 59-year-old told HuffPost. “And that's why I quit.” Ultimately, Anderson Boyd and Kramer agreed that Elite never trained agents to speak with models about sexual misconduct. Both women say they and other agents they knew did not prepare models for how to deal with predatory behavior.   “It was not handled like a traditional corporation where you're handed a sexual harassment manual,” Anderson Boyd said. “I did not know how to help [the models'] working conditions.” Their account matches the experiences of women at other agencies at the time. For example, when former model Lesa Amoore was 17, she said her agent at the now-defunct Riccardo Gay Model Management company warned her that a photographer she was about to shoot with in Milan could “be a little weird.” Amoore said that during the subsequent shoot, when she was wearing only a bra and underwear, the photographer unzipped his pants, pulled out his penis and asked whether he could masturbate. According to the former model, now 48, she put on her clothes and ran out of the room. Amoore said that when she told her agent about the photographer's behavior, he responded, “I'm so sorry, that happens sometimes with him.” Sara Ziff, who began modeling at age 14 in the late '90s and later founded Model Alliance, told The New York Times last year that she too was regularly asked by photographers to get naked or topless without prior warning and, in at least one instance, was told to sit on her male booker's lap.  “When I first started modeling, I did not feel protected by my agency [Next Management],” she told HuffPost. “In some cases, I felt like they were facilitating meetings [with powerful people] that were not clearly work opportunities ― they felt more like being set up on a date.” Though the modeling industry is now more regulated than it was in decades past, abuse is reportedly still frequent. A whopping 87 percent of models say they've been asked to get naked without prior warning, while 30 percent have experienced “inappropriate touching” on the job and 28 percent have been pressured to have sex at work, according to Model Alliance. Model Cameron Russell's Instagram is filled with her own colleagues' stories of being preyed on at go-sees and shoots. A 22-year-old model wrote about how a male photographer pulled down her bra and started kissing her breasts six months ago. Another woman recalled how, as a 14-year-old model, a photographer made her change in front of him, rubbed oil on her legs, and, after asking if she was a virgin, said, “You make me want to go to jail.” The collection of horror stories portrays male photographers masturbating in front of young models, asking for sexual favors, and, in one case, penetrating a 15-year-old with his finger to make the photos “look more sensual.” Ziff said that beyond adhering to the 2013 bill, even the best-intentioned agencies still don't have firm policies in place to protect their models from sexual misconduct. “They tell the girls that if they are in a situation that feels uncomfortable:  'Go to the bathroom and walk out,'  'Feel free to call me,' and  'You don't have to do anything you don't want to do,'” the 35-year-old explained. “[They should] take a preventative approach that doesn't allow those situations to happen in the first place. It's much easier said than done to walk out of a shoot, especially if you're young, maybe English isn't your first language, and you're working with someone who could make or break your career.”  In fact, Model Alliance found that 70 percent of models surveyed didn't feel they could report sexual misconduct to their agencies. Of those who did, two-thirds said their agents didn't consider the behavior problematic, and, in a few cases, even encouraged models to sleep with predators to advance their careers.  Model Jason Boyce, who filed a lawsuit against Bruce Weber for sexual misconduct last year, is also suing his agency, Soul Artist Management. According to the court filing, Boyce claimed the agency knew about Weber's predatory behavior and alleged that his agent told him to “nail” his shoot with the famous photographer. “The culture was: You did what you were told. That was how they sold it,” he said in an interview with The Business of Fashion. “If you do what I tell you, you'll make it. ... My agent told me that all the time.” Jilian Gotlib, a manager and booking agent who worked for Elite in the '80s and re-joined the company in 2005, spoke to HuffPost on behalf of the organization. She disputed Kramer's assertion that agents knowingly sent models to photographers who were rumored to be sexual predators, suggesting that Kramer “goes overboard, maybe, with criticizing the industry.” “We would always be careful, check out [the photographer] and tell our models,  'If [the photographers] ask you to do anything that we didn't tell you was going to happen, let us know,'” she explained. “Some girls would just go ahead anyway, but we would always warn people:  'Call me if anything seems untoward.' I think we would try not to work with a lot of those photographers if we heard problems.” Trudi Tapscott, who worked as an agent and director at Elite from the early '80s until the early '90s, reiterated Gotlib's point, explaining that she told young women about potentially creepy photographers ahead of time. “I've had very honest conversations [about] what to do when [photographers] do this and what to do when [photographers] do that,” she told HuffPost. However, Tapscott added: “At this point I consider [those conversations] complicit. But then I thought I was helping them survive, which sounds so stupid now.” As for alleged in-house predators such as Marie, Gotlib said, “I knew nothing about anything that might have been going on there.”  Throughout her career Kramer worked at four other agencies ― the now-defunct Name Management and Company Management, as well as Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency ― where she said she also regularly witnessed young girls being preyed on at dinner parties and clubs. She said agencies organized events at hot spots such as New York's Indochine or the Ritz in Paris, where models mingled in clouds of cigarette smoke with important editors and photographers who could “make or break careers.” “I saw 14- and 15-year-olds sitting on the laps of these photographers,” she said. “These guys would just have their hands all over these girls.” Ultimately, Kramer said she didn't think she could call out the complicit behavior without losing her job. “Working for Elite [and the other agencies] manipulated me into thinking it was OK,” she said. “I'm not trying to squiggle out of this, by the way. I'm sick to my stomach that I was part of this poison. It sickens me.”  Representatives for Next Management and the Marilyn Model Agency did not respond to HuffPost's request for comment. Kramer left the industry in 2004 when she was working at the Marilyn Model Agency, saying she was disgusted by how young the models had become. But the former agent said she didn't process the sexual misconduct ― or her role in enabling it ― until the following year, when she planned to write a book about her career. “I really started becoming more in touch with,  'Holy shit, what did I do? What did I see? What did I feel? What did I know?'” she said. Kramer never wrote the book, but since her October Facebook post, models have contacted her with more and more stories recalling sexual harassment and assault in the fashion world. Even before posting on social media, Kramer had started working with Ziff at Model Alliance to publicize industry abuse. The organization recently proposed a program to address sexual misconduct in the fashion, entertainment and media industries that would, among other things, have a third party provide sexual harassment training and implement proper complaint procedures. But Kramer says agents still working in the business aren't embracing her efforts. “A lot of people aren't talking to me anymore because they know I'm on top of this,” she said. “They are afraid of losing their standing with these photographers and editors.” There are still many “Terry Richardsons” in the industry, Kramer said, men whose predatory behavior the fashion world ignores. “We all knew Terry Richardson was sexually abusing these girls and yet we still kept sending them on go-sees and to the bookings themselves,” she said. “If you've got a $20 million Revlon contract weighing in the balance ... yet you know Terry is abusing these girls, what do we do? Do we say no to Terry? No, [we] don't.” Moving forward, Kramer believes that if executives at top agencies spoke out about malpractice, they could truly force industrywide change. Kramer also thinks agencies need to stop accepting models under 16, but at the very least, she urges them to better protect young women against possible predators.  “If I could get the owners to say to themselves,  'Maybe we shouldn't send 14-year-olds out on go-sees,' and,  'Maybe we should make sure these photographers that are on the blacklist are never alone with a model,' I would feel my own shame and guilt for not having done more when I was an agent [slightly dissipate],” she said. “[Then] maybe I'd be able to let myself off the hook a little bit.” Do you have a story about harassment or discrimination that you'd like to share?

ARTS & CULTURE,"New Yorker Cover Puts Trump 'In The Hole' After 'Racist' Comment","The New Yorker is taking on President Donald Trump after he asked why the U.S. would welcome immigrants from “shithole” places like Haiti and African countries during a bipartisan Oval Office meeting on Thursday. “In the Hole,” by artist Anthony Russo, responds to the president's comment, which has been decried as racist by the United Nations, with a stark illustration for the magazine's cover in its Jan. 22 issue.  On a field of white, the president's yellowish sweep of hair is just visible from the depths of a black hole: On Thursday, Trump sparked widespread criticism after he reportedly questioned why the U.S. should restore protections for immigrants from Haiti and parts of Africa. “Why are we having all these people from shithole countries come here?” the president said, sources told The Washington Post. “We should have more people from places like Norway,” he added. The New York Times, NBC News, BuzzFeed and CNN confirmed reports of the comment. Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) went on record to say he was in the room when it was made. “He said these hate-filled things and he said them repeatedly,” Durbin said. The White House did not deny the president's phrasing in a statement issued Thursday. Trump strongly denied the derogatory remark against Haiti over Twitter the next day, but neither he nor the White House mentioned his attitude toward African nations.   Lawmakers were in the Oval Office to discuss a plan to help “Dreamers,” the undocumented immigrants who came to the U.S. as children who are nicknamed after the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, program that protected them from deportation. Trump ended DACA in September, but has said he wants to help Dreamers in exchange for progress on his proposed border wall.  CORRECTION: An earlier version of this article misspelled Russo's last name and misidentified Russo as the artist behind a New Yorker cover depicting James Comey being dragged off a plane by Jeff Sessions, which was illustrated by Barry Blitt.

ARTS & CULTURE,"Man Surprises Girlfriend By Drawing Them In Different Animation Styles","Kellen Hickey, a 26-year-old who lives in Hudson, Wisconsin, has gift giving down to a fine art. He drew himself and his girlfriend Lindsay Brinkman, 24, in 10 different animation styles and gave the illustrations to her on Christmas. Hickey told HuffPost that he got the idea a few months ago when he decided to draw the couple as “Futurama” and “Adventure Time” characters and Brinkman absolutely loved them. Her enthusiasm inspired him to draw the two of them in the style of all the cartoons they had bonded over since they began dating in high school. “I am fortunate enough to have the ability to create something that can represent us and our enjoyment of each one of those shows relatively faithfully,” Hickey told HuffPost. “But I have to admit, the “Dragon Ball Z-style drawing was kind of for me.” Hickey says that Brinkman's response to the gift on Christmas was “everything I could've hoped for.” “As soon as she finished [looking through the drawings she] jump-hugged me and was sure to remind me of how much she loves me for the next hour or so.” Proud of his work, Hickey posted the drawings on his Instagram account earlier this week, where they've since gotten a lot of attention online. The couple has framed nine of the photos and have them hanging in their living room. Hickey says Brinkman's favorite is the “Bob's Burgers” illustration. The “Dragon Ball Z”-version of the couple is sitting in a frame on Hickey's work desk. “I'm not sure I could ever properly express how much she inspires me,” Hickey told HuffPost. “None of this would have happened if it weren't for her, her support and the love between us,” he said."

EDUCATION,"How Praise Became A Consolation Prize","As a young researcher, Carol Dweck was fascinated by how some children faced challenges and failures with aplomb while others shrunk back. Dweck, now a psychologist at Stanford University, eventually identified two core mindsets, or beliefs, about one's own traits that shape how people approach challenges: fixed mindset, the belief that one's abilities were carved in stone and predetermined at birth, and growth mindset, the belief that one's skills and qualities could be cultivated through effort and perseverance. Her findings brought the concepts of “fixed” and “growth” mindset to the fore for educators and parents, inspiring the implementation of her ideas among teachers — and even companies — across the country. But Dweck recently noticed a trend: a widespread embrace of what she refers to as “false growth mindset” — a misunderstanding of the idea's core message. Growth mindset's popularity was leading some educators to believe that it was simpler than it was, that it was only about putting forth effort or that a teacher could foster growth mindset merely by telling kids to try hard. A teacher might applaud a child for making an effort on a science test even if he'd failed it, for instance, believing that doing so would promote growth mindset in that student regardless of the outcome. But such empty praise can exacerbate some of the very problems that growth mindset is intended to counter. A new edition of Dweck's book, Mindset: The New Psychology of Success, updated to address false growth mindset, comes out at the end of this month. I recently spoke with Dweck about how she wants her ideas to be applied. The interview has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity. RELATED: When Success Leads to Failure Christine Gross-Loh: Could you tell me about the development of the idea of growth mindset? What was it intended to correct? What were you seeing that you felt growth mindset would help improve? Carol Dweck: I've always been interested, since graduate school, in why some children wilt and shrink back from challenges and give up in the face of obstacles, while others avidly seek challenges and become even more invested in the face of obstacles. So this has been my primary question for over 40 years. At some point, my graduate students and I realized that a student's mindset was at the foundation of whether [he or she] loved challenges and persisted in the face of failure. When students had more of a fixed mindset — the idea that abilities are carved in stone, that you have a certain amount and that's that — they saw challenges as risky. They could fail, and their basic abilities would be called into question. When they hit obstacles, setbacks, or criticism, this was just more proof that they didn't have the abilities that they cherished. In contrast, when students had more of a growth mindset, they held the view that talents and abilities could be developed and that challenges were the way to do it. Learning something new, something hard, sticking to things — that's how you get smarter. Setbacks and feedback weren't about your abilities, they were information you could use to help yourself learn. With a growth mindset, kids don't necessarily think that there's no such thing as talent or that everyone is the same, but they believe everyone can develop their abilities through hard work, strategies, and lots of help and mentoring from others. Gross-Loh: When I first interviewed you about growth mindset a few years ago, I remember that it was a relatively unknown idea. But growth mindset is now so popular that I'll hear people who aren't steeped in educational theory say, “Praise the effort, not the child (or the outcome).” Why do you think this idea struck such a chord, and how did you find out there were people misunderstanding it? Dweck: Many educators were dissatisfied with drilling for high-stakes tests. They understood that student motivation had been a neglected area, especially of late. So many educators, as well as many parents, were excited to implement something that might re-energize kids to focus on learning again, not just memorization and test taking, but on deeper, more joyful learning. But a colleague of mine, Susan Mackie, was doing workshops with educators in Australia and observed that many of them were saying they got growth mindset and were running with it, but did not understand it deeply. She told me, “I'm seeing a lot of false growth mindset.” I just did not get it initially — growth mindset is a very straightforward concept, and besides, why would people settle for a false growth mindset if they could have a real one? But I started keeping a list of all the ways people were misunderstanding growth mindset. When the list got long enough, I started speaking and writing about it. Gross-Loh: Could you elaborate on false growth mindset? Dweck: False growth mindset is saying you have growth mindset when you don't really have it or you don't really understand [what it is]. It's also false in the sense that nobody has a growth mindset in everything all the time. Everyone is a mixture of fixed and growth mindsets. You could have a predominant growth mindset in an area but there can still be things that trigger you into a fixed mindset trait. Something really challenging and outside your comfort zone can trigger it, or, if you encounter someone who is much better than you at something you pride yourself on, you can think “Oh, that person has ability, not me.” So I think we all, students and adults, have to look for our fixed-mindset triggers and understand when we are falling into that mindset. I think a lot of what happened [with false growth mindset among educators] is that instead of taking this long and difficult journey, where you work on understanding your triggers, working with them, and over time being able to stay in a growth mindset more and more, many educators just said, “Oh yeah, I have a growth mindset” because either they know it's the right mindset to have or they understood it in a way that made it seem easy.   RELATED: The American Obsession With Parenting  Gross-Loh: Why do you think these misunderstandings occurred? Dweck: Many people understood growth mindset deeply and implemented it in a very sophisticated and effective way. However, there were many others who understood it in a way that wasn't quite accurate, or distilled it down to something that wasn't quite effective, or assimilated it into something they already knew. Often when we see kids who aren't learning well, we might feel frustrated or defensive, thinking it reflects on us as educators. It's often tempting to not feel it is our fault. So we might say the child has a fixed mindset, without understanding instead that, as educators, it is our responsibility to create a context in which a growth mindset can flourish. Gross-Loh: So it seems that the danger is that some teachers think they have growth mindset and believe it will transfer to their students, even though they themselves don't really understand it. How about this: Are there educators who do understand the idea that abilities can be developed, but don't understand how to pass it on to students? Are there certain children who are more vulnerable to this sort of misunderstanding of growth mindset? Dweck: Yes, another misunderstanding [of growth mindset] that might apply to lower-achieving children is the oversimplification of growth mindset into just [being about] effort. Teachers were just praising effort that was not effective, saying “Wow, you tried really hard!” But students know that if they didn't make progress and you're praising them, it's a consolation prize. They also know you think they can't do any better. So this kind of growth-mindset idea was misappropriated to try to make kids feel good when they were not achieving. The mindset ideas were developed as a counter to the self-esteem movement of blanketing everyone with praise, whether deserved or not. To find out that teachers were using it in the same way was of great concern to me. The whole idea of growth-mindset praise is to focus on the learning process. When you focus on effort, [you have to] show how effort created learning progress or success. Gross-Loh: What should people do to avoid falling into this trap? Dweck: A lot of parents or teachers say praise the effort, not the outcome. I say [that's] wrong: Praise the effort that led to the outcome or learning progress; tie the praise to it. It's not just effort, but strategy … so support the student in finding another strategy. Effective teachers who actually have classrooms full of children with a growth mindset are always supporting children's learning strategies and showing how strategies created that success. Students need to know that if they're stuck, they don't need just effort. You don't want them redoubling their efforts with the same ineffective strategies. You want them to know when to ask for help and when to use resources that are available. All of this is part of the process that needs to be taught and tied to learning. RELATED: The Coddling of the American Mind Gross-Loh: Is there a right way to praise kids and encourage them to do well? Dweck: Many parents and teachers who themselves have growth mindset aren't passing it on because they are trying to protect the child's confidence, focus on the child's ability, and kind of boost the child's view or protect the child from a failure. They're conveying anxiety about ability.   But we have a new line of research (with my former graduate student, Kyla Haimovitz) showing that the way a parent reacts to a child's failure conveys a mindset to a child regardless of the parent's mindset. If parents react to their child's failures as though there is something negative, if they rush in, are anxious, reassure the child, “Oh not everyone can be good at math, don't worry, you're good at other things,” the child gets it that no, this is important, and it's fixed. That child is developing a fixed mindset, even if the parent has a growth mindset. But if the parent reacts to a child's failure as though it's something that enhances learning, asking, “Okay, what is this teaching us? Where should we go next? Should we talk to the teacher about how we can learn this better?” that child comes to understand that abilities can be developed. So, with praise, focus on “process praise” — focus on the learning process and show how hard work, good strategies, and good use of resources lead to better learning. Be matter-of-fact, with not too strong or too passive a reaction. You can see evidence of fixed mindset as young as 3.5 or 4 years old; that's when mindsets can start becoming evident, where some kids are very upset when they make a mistake or get criticized and fall into a helpless place. That's when children become able to evaluate themselves. We collaborated … with researchers from the University of Chicago who had a longitudinal project with videotape of mother-child interactions. What we found was the more praise was process-oriented — not a ton, just where the greater proportion of the praise was process praise [versus outcome praise] — the more those children had a growth mindset and a high desire for challenge five years later, when they were in second grade. Gross-Loh: That's very helpful to know for parents of young children.  But what about older kids who might feel discouraged and worn-down after years of feeling that they weren't smart enough or a fear that they would never be able to be successful? Is it ever too late to foster a growth mindset in students? Dweck: No — we've developed a number of online workshops addressed at adolescents and shown that when we teach [those] students a growth mindset, many of them regain their motivation to learn and achieve higher grades, especially students who have been struggling or students who have been laboring under a negative stereotype about [their own] abilities. Research conducted last year by my former graduate student, David Yeager [now a professor at the University of Texas], on 18,000 students entering ninth grade, shows us that students who took growth-mindset workshops are seeking more challenges. You can't tell adolescents, “We're adults, we have the answer, and we're going to tell you what it is.” So we said, “We're scientists from Stanford University and the University of Texas, and we need your help. We're experts on the brain and how students learn, but you're the experts on being a freshman in high school and we'd like your input for a program we're developing for future freshmen.” We then taught them about how the teenage brain is especially open to learning. We talked about how it's a time of great plasticity, a time they need to take advantage of, and that they can grow their brains through taking on hard tasks in school and sticking to them. We had the students write a letter to a struggling freshman, counseling that person in terms of the growth-mindset principle, which is often very persuasive. We had testimonials from some public figures, talking about how a growth mindset got them to where they were. Finally we talked about why someone would want a growth mindset. We realized that some kids would be overjoyed to hear you can develop your intellectual abilities, but others might not think it was the most exciting thing. So we then had a whole section on why you might want to develop your mind. Teenagers are really excited about the idea that they can do something to make the world a better place. So we asked them what they want to make their contribution to in the future — family, community, or societal problems — and then talked about how having a strong mind could help them make their future contribution. We're excited about this because we know the world of the future is going to be about taking on ill-defined, hard jobs that keep changing. It's going to favor people who relish those challenges and know how to fix them. We are committed to creating a nation of learners."
EDUCATION,"I Am A Public School Teacher. Give Me All The Refugees You've Got!","Come into my classroom any day of the week and you'll see refugees. That little Iraqi boy slumped over a book written in Arabic while the rest of the class reads the same story in English. Those twin girls blinking back memories of the Bosnian War as they try to underline possessive nouns on an English worksheet. That brown-skinned boy compulsively rocking back-and-forth in his seat fighting back tears wondering when his dad is going to come home from prison. Every day, every hour, every minute our public schools are places of refuge for children seeking asylum, fugitives, emigres, exiles, the lost, the displaced, dear hearts seeking a kind word and a caring glance. Some may shudder or sneer at the prospect of giving shelter to people in need, but that is the reality in our public schools. In the lives of many, many children we provide the only stability, the only safety, and the only love they get all day. And, yes, I do mean love. I love my students. Each and every one of them. Sometimes they are far from lovable. Sometimes they look at me with distrust. They bristle at assignments. They jump when redirected. But those are the ones I try to love the most, because they are the ones most in need. I told a friend once that I had a student who had escaped from Iraq. His parents had collaborated with the U.S. military and received death threats for their efforts. So he and his family fled to my hometown so far away from his humid desert heartland. I told her how difficult it was trying to communicate with a student who spoke hardly any English. I complained about budget cuts that made it next to impossible to get an English Language Learner (ELL) instructor to help me more than once a week. And her response was, “Do you feel safe teaching this kid?” Do I feel safe? The question had never occurred to me. Why wouldn't I feel safe? I don't expect ISIS to track him down across the Atlantic Ocean to my class. Nor do I expect this sweet little guy is going to do anything to me except practice his English. In one of my first classrooms, I had a dozen refugees from Yugoslavia. They had escaped from Slobadan Milosevic's ethnic cleansing. Yet you'd never know unless they told you. They were some of the most well-behaved, thoughtful, intelligent children I've had the pleasure to teach. They were always smiling, so happy to be here. They approached every assignment with a seriousness well beyond their years. But sometimes you'd see a shadow cross their faces. Rarely you'd hear them whispering among themselves. I was so new I didn't know any better but to come down on them. But later they told me what they had been talking about, what they had been thinking about ― how Henry V's military campaign brought back memories. They taught me that day. Every year I learn so much from my children. My high-poverty school doesn't get a lot of refugees from overseas these days. But we're overwhelmed with exiles from our own neighborhood. I can't tell you how many children I've had in class who start off the year at one house and then move to another. I can't tell you how many come to school bruised and beaten. I can't tell you how many ask a moment of my time between classes, during my planning period or after school just to talk. Last week one of my students walked up to me and said, “I'm having a nervous breakdown.” Class had just been dismissed. I had a desk filled to the ceiling with ungraded essays. I still had to make copies for tomorrow's parent-teacher conferences. I had gotten to none of it earlier because I had to cover another class during my planning period. But I pushed all of that aside and talked with my student for over an hour. And I'm not alone. On those few days I get to leave close to on-time, I see other teachers doing just like me conferencing and tutoring kids after school. It was a hard conversation. I had to show him he was worth something. I had to make him feel that he was important to other people, that people cared about him. I hope I was successful. He left with a handshake and a smile. He may not be from far away climes, but he's a refugee, too. He's seeking a safe place, a willing ear, a kind word. So you'll forgive me if I sigh impatiently when some in the media and in the government complain about the United States accepting more refugees. What a bunch of cowards! They act as if it's a burden. They couldn't be farther from the truth. It's a privilege. When I see that iconic picture of three-year-old Syrian boy Aylan Kurdi drowned in Turkey as his family tried to escape the conflict, I find it impossible that anyone could actually refuse these people help. Just imagine! There are a host of others just like this family seeking asylum and we can give it! We have a chance to raise them up, to provide them a place to live, to shelter them from the storm. What an honor! What a privilege! What a chance to be a beacon of light on a day of dark skies! I'm an American, middle-class white male. My life hasn't been trouble-free, but I know that I've won the lottery of circumstances. Through none of my own doing, I sit atop the social ladder. It is my responsibility to offer a helping hand in every way I can to those on the lower rungs. It is my joy to be able to do it. It's what I do every day at school. When I trudge to my car in the evening dark, I'm exhausted to the marrow of my bones. But I wouldn't have it any other way. It's not uncommon for a student or two to see me on the way to my car, shout out my name with glee and give me an impromptu hug. At the end of the day, I know I've made a difference. I love being a teacher. So if we're considering letting in more refugees, don't worry about me. Send them all my way. I'll take all you've got. That's what public schools do. NOTE: I originally wrote this article for my blog, the Gadflyonthewall Blog."
EDUCATION,"5 Tips For Teacher Leaders","Teachers are alternately characterized in modern culture as “those who can't do” and as indispensable key players in the building of a better America. In the days of one-room schoolhouses teachers were viewed as not only educational leaders, but also the cornerstones of every neighborhood and community. As schools grew into school systems the role of the teacher changed. Where teachers were once considered unquestioned educational experts, they have become a piece of a much larger institutional puzzle. In 1986 the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching recommended that schools identify “lead teachers” who would model high-yield teaching strategies that could be modeled for their colleagues. Over the last 30 years schools have gradually embraced more opportunities for teachers to have formal and informal leadership positions. Whether they have the title of Department Chair, Instructional Coach, Lead Teacher, Model Teacher, Mentor Teacher, or provide leadership by example, every school has teachers who step forward to provide leadership for their peers. While the idea of shared leadership between administrators and teacher leaders is noble, it is not without challenges. Sharing the responsibilities of professional learning, creating accountability, and making critical institutional decisions is not always the easiest way to run a school or school system, but it does create the conditions for more ownership of the work that is being done. Shared leadership also puts more responsibility for action in the hands of those who are actually interacting with students each and every day. Any teacher who steps forward to lead is taking a risk. Below are five tips for teachers engaging in leadership to consider as they tackle the challenges of teacher leadership. 1) Flatten hierarchies at every opportunity. The goal of a quality formalized teacher leadership program is to flatten hierarchies; unfortunately they are often perceived as simply creating a new layer of hierarchy within a school or system. The work of teacher leaders must be to lift up their colleagues. Many times the most important work a teacher leader can do is to be a connector. If we can help connect our colleagues with materials, resources, and available support we are doing our jobs well. The job of a teacher leader isn't to know more than their peers, but it is to act as a resource. It is important for teacher leaders to listen to their colleagues and to be sure their system is doing all it can to put the necessary resources in the appropriate hands. If the role of a teacher leader is to simply transmit information from administrators to teachers, the teacher leader is bound for failure. 2) Be transparent. As new teacher leadership roles are developed it can be a challenge to define them. It is important for teacher leaders to be empowered to create roles that address the real needs of their schools. With the power to define these roles comes the responsibility for teacher leaders to be transparent in their work. Leaders must make their work as public and visible as possible. One of the most common complaints teachers have of administrators is that they don't get out of their offices to see what's happening in classrooms. Teacher leaders have to recognize that the strength of their roles should be that they are actively engaged in the work of teaching and learning. 3) Build a network. In many schools there may be only one Instructional Coach, Lead Teacher, or any other role. It is easy for a teacher leader to feel isolated in one of these roles. It is critical that teacher leaders develop a network of support within their schools, districts, and beyond. Social networks like Twitter can provide an excellent source of support for teachers. Most importantly, find colleagues in your area that have a similar role and get together; share the challenges and rewards of the work that you are doing. 4) Take risks. Schools aren't going to see growth if they don't take risks. It is important for teachers who consider themselves to be leaders to model a willingness to be early adopters of new ideas and innovative practices. Inherent in being a risk-taker is a willingness to fail. Maybe more important than a willingness to fail is a willingness to be transparent when an initiative or idea fails. Real leaders understand that not everything that they try will work, but they model resilience in the face of failure and never give up. 5) Recognize all of the leaders around you. Every teacher is a leader, whether they recognize it or not. Collective teacher efficacy (the collective belief that our work as teachers makes a difference in the ability of our students to grow) is considered by researcher John Hattie to be the number one factor in influencing student achievement. The act of supporting student learning in our schools is an act of leadership. Teacher leaders must know that the greatest talent in any room is the collective talent of those in the room. The work of teacher leadership must be to empower our profession. Not only should teacher leaders help build the capacity of their colleagues, but true teacher leaders should be relying on our colleagues to build our capacity as well. Whether you are a teacher leader with a title and a clearly defined role or a teacher who leads in any other capacity, know that your work is important. Teachers are the key to great schools and the more invested all of us become in being partners in providing leadership, the better our schools are going to be."
EDUCATION,"Do Test Scores Measure “Success”?","Success Academy charter school network CEO Eva Moskowitz called a press conference last week to claim success. According to Moskowitz, she was “goosebump proud” of the networks performance on state Common Core exams. She also took the opportunity, Trump-style, to lash out at the public schools for “educational racism” and Mayor Bill de Blasio for recognizing overall improvement in student test scores and not celebrating success at Success. Moskowitz's press conference was also called to defend the Success Academy Network against charges of racial insensitivity. The President of its Board of Directors made comments on twitter insulting a State Senator who is an African American woman. The Success Academy network, although not every school, has a student body over 90% Black and Latino. Network schools averages very high passing rates on the standardized English or Language Arts and Math tests for students grades 3 to 8. But according to the online journal Chalkbeat, critics continue to charge that Success Academy owes its “success” to systematically enrolling fewer high-needs students and pushing out children and families who do not adapt to its abusive environment and test-prep curriculum. Success is New York City's largest charter school network and has ties to deep-pocket political donors and support from some of the state's most powerful politicians. But it is also accused of discriminating against students with disabilities in a formal complaint filled by former Success parents and New York City Public Advocate Letitia James. In January 2017 the principal of Success' Cobble Hill school took a leave of absence after it became public that the school had a “got to go” list of children officials wanted out of their program.  Other scandals have rocked the network as well. A video, filmed in fall 2014, showed a Success “model teacher” ripping up the paper of an African American girl about the age of six. She then sent the girl to a punishment “calm-down chair” and yelled at the entire class, “There's nothing that infuriates me more than when you don't do what's on your paper.” Eva Moskowitz dismissed the teacher's behavior in the video as an “anomaly” and accused the New York Times, which reported the incident, of a vendetta against the network. Moskowitz, Success Academy, and its political supporters are engaged in a campaign to secure permission from the State University of New York Board of Trustees for charter schools to hire uncertified personnel as teachers. Under the plan they would be trained to teach by Success “model teachers” and “got to go” principals in the charter industry's questionable classroom approaches. On its website, Success Academy reported “For the ninth consecutive year, Success Academy Charter Schools have scored among the highest-performing schools in New York State,” claiming that “students with disabilities and English Language Learners at Success Academy schools not only surpassed their peers statewide, but also outperformed students without disabilities and native English speakers, respectively, across New York.”  But a closer look at a successful Success school shows how selective recruitment and pressure to leave “cooks the books.” According to the website Inside Schools, Success Cobble Hill of “got to go” fame, with 469 students grades K-5, has 10% of its students with registered disabilities and 5% who are English Language Learners, compared to 16% of students citywide with registered disabilities and 14% who are ELL. Students with disabilities and ELL are also very broad categories. For teaching and testing, there is a big difference between a middle-class student who has a 504 designation for mild attention deficit syndrome and needs additional time to complete tests and assignments, and a disruptive student with severe emotional issues or a student with serious learning difficulties. ELL students range through four categories from new arrivals who speak no English and may never have attended school in their home country to children who are very literate in their first language and are rapidly mastering English. An accurate comparison of schools requires knowing who the students are that attend the schools. One-third of the students at Success Cobble Hill are listed as either White or Asian, an unusually high percentage for an inner-city minority school. About 15% of New York City elementary school students are from families that are homeless, another hard to teach population missing at Success schools because they are unable to complete the application process. Success Cobble Hill shares a building at 284 Baltic Street in Brooklyn with three other schools, including Public School 368K, which is a special-education program working with the children that Success Academy does not want. The Success formula seems to be, if you eliminate the difficult to reach kids, and pull in more middle class kids, your average test scores magically go up. This summer, Shavar Jeffries, President of the pro-charter Democrats for Education Reform, resigned from the Success Academy Charter School Network Board of Directors. Both Moskowitz and Jeffries refuse to publically comment on the resignation. However, they sharply disagree about how to respond to the Trump or DeVos national school agenda. Jeffries urges Democratic Party charter school advocates to distance themselves from Trump or DeVos attacks on public education and support for for-profit charters. Meanwhile Moskowitz cozied up to Trump, endorsed Betsy DeVos as Secretary of Education, and provided photo-ops in her schools for his team. It may just be that success at Success demonstrates the illegitimacy of the entire national high-stakes testing regime. Before celebrating Success Academy test scores and granting the network waivers to hire uncertified teachers, New York State education officials should investigate how the schools operate. If they do magic, they deserve credit. If it is a smoke and mirrors show that produces test scores through selective recruitment and the intimidation of children and families, it should be shut down."
EDUCATION,"Exclusive: Data Show Charter School Students Graduating From College At Three To Five Times National Average","About a decade ago, 15 years into the public charter school movement, a few of the nation's top charter networks quietly upped the ante on their own strategic goals. No longer was it sufficient to keep students “on track” to college. Nor was it enough to enroll 100 percent of your graduates in colleges. What mattered, concluded the charter leaders, was getting your students through college - ensuring they earned a four-year bachelor's degree within six years of graduating from high school. Hold us accountable, the educators said, for how our kids do once they leave us, marking a remarkable paradigm shift in the way charter schools define success. The initial spark may have happened in the 2008-09 school year, when KIPP realized its graduates were struggling in college. The network changed the name of its college success program from “KIPP To College” to “KIPP Through College” - a seemingly small tweak that signaled huge changes ahead. Uncommon Schools was hearing similar feedback from its alumni, who faced financial challenges, struggled with being away from home, and felt uncomfortable at predominantly white colleges. Changes were required to ensure alumni not only gained access to college but actually earned degrees. So Uncommon Schools moved in the same direction as KIPP, and other charter networks followed. The shift is yet another example of the intense sharing of best practices between America's top charter networks, as documented in The Founders. Today, the college graduation goal has been widely adopted, even by many single-site charters. At the small, relatively new Boston Prep, which serves students in grades 6-12, for example, classes are referred to not by the year students will graduate from high school, but the year they expect students to graduate from college. Next month, incoming sixth-graders will begin introducing themselves as the Class of 2028. For several reasons, this dramatic strategic shift has drawn limited attention outside the charter school world, in part because to outsiders it seems to be a cross between brash and outlandish. For starters, the proof of achieving the goal seemed nonexistent, at least at the time. Many charter networks were first launched only with elementary grades, and were too new to even conceptualize future alumni who could become college graduates. Another reason the new goal has drawn so little attention is the common acceptance that students and the colleges they attend - not the students' high schools, or even middle schools, in some cases - are responsible for whether those students earn college degrees. But the charter networks are sticking to their new strategic goals, despite skepticism that high schools should be held responsible for whether their graduates earn college degrees. KIPP kids, CEO Richard Barth told me, are like family. You don't just let family members leave home without helping them achieve their future goals. At most, traditional high schools publish “college readiness” reports. In California, for example, parents can learn how many students at their local high school met the “A-G” course requirements required by the University of California system. Many traditional high schools and private schools also grade themselves by calculating the number of their graduates accepted into colleges - but then rarely follow up to ensure that those students even enroll in their freshman year of college, let alone complete their studies to earn degrees. Problem is, the traditional high school measures of college readiness are crude, as seen by the shockingly high number of incoming college freshmen who require remedial coursework before they are even allowed to take for-credit courses - a fault that leads to millions of degree-earning failures. This makes the new goal set by the major charter school networks, to grade themselves on the percentage of their students who go on to earn four-year college degrees in six years, all the more radical - especially given the fact that these networks educate low-income, minority students, whose college graduation rates pale in comparison to their more affluent white peers - a mere 9 percent earning degrees within six years, compared with 77 percent of students from high-income families as of 2015. If public and private high schools across the country catch on, this seemingly small ideological tweak in the charter sector has the potential to transform the entire American education system. Now, for the first time, it's possible to start answering the question of whether that goal is achievable. We identified nine large charter networks with enough alumni to roughly calculate degree-earning success rates. Chicago-based Noble Network of Charter Schools, for example, has more than 10 300 alumni, 1 444 of them past the six-year mark. Other networks have far fewer at the six-year point, but a sufficient number to measure meaningfully. At this point in time, the quality of the data available for tracking their progress ranges from rough estimates to moderately precise, with the bulk coming from the non-government National Student Clearinghouse, which matches high school, college, and other identifier records to track students as they progress through higher education. The charter networks purchase the data from the Clearinghouse. To account for imperfections in the Clearinghouse data, some charter networks also use internal tracking systems to ensure no student falls through the cracks. Others rely solely on the raw Clearinghouse numbers and don't have systems in place to track on top of the Clearinghouse. Another important notation about the data, which we explore in greater detail here, has to do with the denominator. KIPP is a fervent believer that college graduation cohort data should be tracked from ninth grade - not 12th grade, the starting point that the other charter networks included in this study use. For students who attend KIPP middle schools, KIPP tracks them when they graduate from eighth grade to ensure they are kept track of, regardless of whether they go to a KIPP high school. For students who go to non-KIPP middle schools and start attending KIPP as high schoolers, they track them when they start ninth grade. The problem with starting in 12th grade, argues KIPP, is that it could tempt schools to push out weaker students during high school years, thus allowing the stronger students to boost the schools' college-going and college-completion rates. KIPP may be right. But in The Alumni, where KIPP is the only network that is currently tracking students from ninth grade, we have decided it is important to share cohort graduation rates that start in 12th grade. What's key to this series is learning what works in boosting that college graduation rate - lessons that could be passed along to all schools, not just charters. Moving everyone to the gold standard is the next step. Below are the reported numbers of students who have earned a four-year college degree within six years of high school graduation. For the one charter network that tracks students from ninth grade: For the eight charter networks that track students from the beginning of 12th grade, three compile their own data on top of Clearinghouse tracking: Of those 314 upperclassmen, 162 fit the above criteria for being on track to graduation. This places Achievement First's projected six-year college graduation rate at 52 percent. The remaining networks that track students from the beginning of 12th grade rely solely on Clearinghouse data: One outlier: (The figures above raise numerous questions. Where do the numbers come from? How accurate are they? What about the dropouts? Why the big differences. among the networks? For a more thorough discussion of the data, click here.) If you are a high-income white or Asian parent, these degree-earning rates will not impress. Among those parents, 79 percent of their children earn four-year degrees within six years after graduating from high school. But because these charter networks almost exclusively educate low-income and minority students, the question has to be framed differently. The challenges faced by these students are incomparable to children from most upper-income families. One quick example: In a 2017 internal survey of KIPP alumni currently in college, 43 percent said they had missed meals so they could have money for books, fees, and other expenses. Most alarming: 57 percent worried that food would run out before more money for food arrived. So, let's put these charter success rates in context. Among all students attending all types of schools in America, only about 9 percent of students from low-income families earn college degrees within six years. That means some of the top charter networks listed above, those in the 50 percent range, are doing five times as well. Further, there's tantalizing evidence in the college “persistence” data kept by these charters, where they monitor alumni still in college to determine if they are on track to earn diplomas, suggesting that bigger gains may be unfolding within a few years. Since the 2010-11 school year, for example, KIPP's New York region was able to boost its six-year diploma-earning rate from 33 percent to 46 percent. Individual charters that were early pioneers also have sufficient numbers of alumni to take a measure of their college success. Boston's Academy of the Pacific Rim, for example, opened its doors in 1997 and now has 489 graduates since the class of 2003, its first graduating class, including 220 who have reached the six-year mark. Among those: 70 percent earned four-year degrees, the highest success rate we've come across in this project for a charter that targets low-income students. If these rising success rates prove to be true, the civil rights and anti-poverty implications are significant. Is it possible to identify any anti-poverty program that has demonstrated effectiveness of this magnitude? In the education field alone, consider Head Start, an early childhood education program that platoons of statisticians have argued about for decades, citing evidence of either small gains or no gains, depending on which study. What these charter networks are doing with college graduation goes far beyond scratching around for small-bore gains. As part of this series, we profile most of the major players who have graduates past the six-year mark and describe their college preparation and tracking strategies. Interestingly, the most compelling stories about improving college graduation rates may arise from the charter networks new to the push to make sure their graduates make it through college. Los Angeles-based Alliance College-Ready Public Schools, for example, has a lower college success rate of 25 percent. That's in part due to their rapid push into expanding the number of high school students they serve. They were also late to shift their focus toward tracking alumni in college, and they strive to limit additional spending on expensive guidance programs, for example, so they can offer themselves as a model that succeeds with low-income students relying on the same funding that goes to traditional public schools. Can Alliance's recent, low-cost method of using alumni and mentors boost their low degree-earning rates? That lesson may prove more valuable than lessons learned from KIPP's more expensive college-tracking network, especially to traditional school districts unable to afford teams tracking their students into and through college. If Alliance can make meaningful gains, then so could thousands of traditional school districts. And the same observation holds for Green Dot, which started its college-tracking effort only two years ago. The charter networks profiled in this series are pioneers in this campaign - fulfilling one of their original charter school missions of becoming incubators of innovation. As such, their discoveries matter greatly. Here's a taste of what the front runners are learning: High school grade point averages matter far more than expected, and efforts to bolster GPA in high school give students the persistence skills needed to make it through college. Another key lesson learned: Like it or not, SAT scores matter a lot - not just in getting admitted, but also in persisting - which means pushing high school juniors into extensive preparation work for the test. And the bottom line of every charter network: Research the hell out of which colleges work for their kids, and make sure they go there! What readers are likely to find compelling about the charter networks profiled in this project are the different approaches used. KIPP, for example, throws its muscle into KIPP Through College, a hands-on campaign that tracks their students all the way through college. At Uncommon Schools, the muscle focuses more on revamping and strengthening the academic program in grades 5-12 to give their graduates a tailwind through college. Which works better? At the moment, both networks show roughly equal results. There are some lessons that all the networks are discovering independently. Higher-ranked colleges do a far better job seeing their students through to a diploma. (In some cases, that range can be dramatic: 90-plus percent success at an elite college, compared with 15 percent or even lower at non-selective universities.) Thus, college counselors do their best to push students to apply for their “reach” schools. Among the middle-ranked and lower-ranked universities, some do far better than others at ensuring that low-income students win degrees. So, all the charter networks employ aggressive counseling to keep their seniors away from the lesser-rated institutions. Noble network charters has a particularly interesting story there. Another surprise finding: Many small but selective colleges that have traditionally enrolled nearly all-white student bodies, and are located in rural communities in states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio, are proving to be great collaborators with inner-city charters. Those colleges are seeing graduation rates above 90 percent with charter students. Who saw that coming? To diversify their campuses, these colleges eagerly seek out well-prepared minority students (not just minority students from the middle and upper-middle class who went to suburban or private schools, but urban minority students truly in need of a boost) and are willing to take dramatic steps to ensure their success on their campuses. The challenge for college counselors at these urban charters: getting their students equipped to survive far from home in an environment where few of their classmates share similar backgrounds as theirs: low-income minorities, some of whom are undocumented. While college-degree-earning rates may be important, the longer-lasting and still barely noticed development here is the declaration by the KIPPs, Uncommons, Achievement Firsts, YES Preps, and other networks across the country that earning college degrees should be the ultimate accountability measure for their high schools. This is something new - and potentially revolutionary. In years past, K-12 accountability measures focused on data points such as third-grade reading scores, the number of ninth-graders taking algebra, or setting new records for the most number of AP tests taken and passed. My prediction: Those data points will remain markers but will be subsumed by the far larger data point of college completion. Like it or not, college is the new high school, regardless of the chosen career. Who doesn't need to be a careful reader and writer to work in sophisticated blue-collar jobs? We need to judge high schools by how many of their graduates earn college degrees within six years. And while charter leaders don't want to stir up more controversy by saying it out loud, the implication is clear: Traditional high schools need to get on board with the same goal. Again, college is the new high school. And that rule applies equally to low-income minority students, who make up half the student bodies of our nation's public schools."
BUSINESS,"Report: Uber Board Accept Holder's Recommendations, Discuss CEO Kalanick's Absence","The Uber Technologies Inc. board of directors voted unanimously to adopt all recommendations from a report stemming from allegations of sexual harassment at the company and other employee concerns, a board representative said on Sunday. The board, at a meeting on Sunday, adopted a series of recommendations from former U.S Attorney General Eric Holder following a sprawling, multi-month investigation into Uber's cultures and practices. The recommendations will be released to Uber employees on Tuesday, said the representative, who declined to be identified. Holder's recommendations included imposing new controls on company spending, human resources and other areas where executives had wide discretion. Also at the meeting on Sunday, board members were expected to discuss Uber Chief Executive Travis Kalanick temporarily stepping away from the embattled ride-hailing firm and other changes to executive leadership. Kalanick has developed a reputation as an abrasive leader, and his approach has rubbed off on his company. The 40-year-old executive was captured on video in February berating an Uber driver. Uber board member Arianna Huffington said in March that Kalanick needed to change his leadership style from that of a “scrappy entrepreneur” to be more like a “leader of a major global company.” The board has been looking for a chief operating officer to help Kalanick run the company since March. The report was prepared by Holder and partner Tammy Albarran at Covington & Burling. It comes shortly after another law firm, Perkins Coie, submitted a separate report on sexual harassment and other employee concerns at the company. On Tuesday, Uber responded to that report's findings by saying it had fired 20 employees for a variety of reasons, and was increasing training and adopting new policies. Uber said that report considered 215 cases encompassing sexual harassment, discrimination, unprofessional behavior, bullying and other employee complaints. MORE OVERSIGHT ON CEO? San Francisco-based Uber is valued at nearly $70 billion but has yet to turn a profit. Some of the recommendations in Holder's firm's report would force greater controls on spending, human resources and other areas where executives led by Kalanick have had a surprising amount of autonomy for a company with more than 12,000 employees, one person familiar with the matter said. Uber's more than 1.5 million drivers worldwide are classified as independent contractors rather than employees. Less clear is the fate of Kalanick, who with close allies has voting control of the company. The person briefed on the matter said the board will discuss Kalanick taking time off from the company. The discussion involved the possibility that Kalanick might return in a role with less authority, this person said, either in a position other than CEO or as CEO with narrower responsibilities and subject to stronger oversight. Kalanick is also facing a personal trauma: his mother died last month in a boating accident, in which his father was also badly injured.   HOLDER INTERVIEWS Employees and former employees interviewed by Holder's team complained about sexual and racial bias, bullying and retaliation, according to people familiar with their accounts. They said that Kalanick and his lieutenants had favorites who played by different rules than other employees, and that even those favorites were nervous that they could fall from grace, which they sometimes did. Uber declined comment on that characterization. One of the issues that came to Holder's team's attention, according to two people familiar with the matter, was the company's handling of a crisis in India after one of its drivers was arrested for raping a customer. Though the man was convicted in 2015, Kalanick and other executives became convinced that the crime was a set up by a local competitor, former employees said. Eric Alexander, the head of Asian business, shared medical records internally that he argued showed that the woman had been assaulted but not raped, people who spoke to him said. Alexander was fired this week; he did not return messages seeking comment. Uber confirmed Alexander had left the company but declined to discuss the matter further."
BUSINESS,"Why Successful People Never Bring Smartphones Into Meetings","You are annoying your boss and colleagues any time you take your phone out during meetings, says new research from USC's Marshall School of Business, and if you work with women and people over forty they're even more perturbed by it than everyone else. The researchers conducted a nationwide survey of 554 full-time working professionals earning above $30K and working in companies with at least 50 employees. They asked a variety of questions about smartphone use during meetings and found: 86 percent think it's inappropriate to answer phone calls during meetings. 84 percent think it's inappropriate to write texts or emails during meetings. 66 percent think it's inappropriate to write texts or emails even during lunches offsite. The more money people make the less they approve of smartphone use. The study also found that Millennials are three times more likely than those over 40 to think that smartphone use during meetings is okay, which is ironic considering Millennials are highly dependent upon the opinions of their older colleagues for career advancement. TalentSmart has tested the emotional intelligence of more than a million people worldwide and found that Millennials have the lowest self-awareness in the workplace, making them unlikely to see that their smartphone use in meetings is harming their careers. Why do so many people - especially successful people - find smartphone use in meetings to be inappropriate? When you take out your phone it shows a: I can't say I'm surprised by the USC study's findings.

ENVIRONMENT,"15 Vegan Celebrities Who've Given Up Animal Products For A Healthier Lifestyle","More people than you may have thought are on plant-based and animal-free diets: PETA reports that 2.5 percent of U.S. residents are vegans while another 5 percent are vegetarians. Celebrities are no strangers to these dietary changes: big names like Bill Clinton or Ellen DeGeneres and now Al Gore are all on board with veganism. Just how nutritious is this plant-based diet though? Experts note it can be one of the healthiest ways to eat as you'll limit calories and harmful fats while still consuming vitamins and minerals. It's also good for the environment; it uses fewer resources and doesn't support industrial livestock farms which often face criticism for their treatment of animals and environmental waste. Many celebrities have adopted the diet for personal or environmental reasons and are speaking up for this lifestyle. Take a look at some of veganism's most prominent supporters below. CORRECTION: A previous version of this article misstated the name of The Smiths' song "Meat is Murder." This article also previously included Betty White who is an animal lover but not a vegan."
ENVIRONMENT,"Beyond COP 19: Accelerating Climate Protection","As the climate crisis intensifies, extreme weather events such as the devastating Typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines are becoming increasingly frequent. At the final hour, a compromise was reached between representatives of the developed and developing countries on a funding “mechanism” to pay for climate-related “loss and damage” at the recent 19th Annual Meeting of UNFCCC (United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change) known as COP 19 (Conference of the Parties) in Warsaw. While this represents a victory for the Group of 77 developing countries, the vague, non-binding wording of the final document fell far short of the detailed funding commitment expected from developed nations. The focus in Warsaw was on “climate justice”: funding from the rich industrial nations to compensate for   their historically disproportionate emissions of greenhouse gas, which have contributed significantly to environmental disasters in poorer countries. To be sure, mechanisms for “climate justice” are necessary to mitigate the effects of climate-induced disasters and ensure the survival of climate refugees. However, climate justice and “benefit-sharing solutions” should not be allowed to divert attention from the urgent need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions on a global scale. All countries agreed to make contributions to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. However, COP 19 failed to secure a binding agreement from any country to limit emissions. Even minimal efforts to address climate change have been derailed by international economic competition. Industrializing countries such as China, India, and Brazil want developed countries in the Global North to take the lead in drastic emissions reductions. Fearing loss of their economic edge, the “rich, powerful and deeply fossil-fuel addicted” countries of the Global North want to move away from even the targets and obligations to which they had previously agreed.  The United States, for example, has never ratified the Kyoto Protocol. Canada and Australia are increasing emissions. Japan declared it could not achieve the promised emission reductions and gave itself an “extremely weak target” at the COP 19. Emissions from developing nations now exceed those of developed countries, with China being the largest contributor of greenhouse gases. In Warsaw, heavy polluters like China and India refused to take on specific reduction goals. China led a group of developing nations in arguing for more flexibility for poorer nations with regards to meeting climate change commitments by 2015, when a new climate treaty is to be signed in Paris to replace the failed Kyoto Protocol.  While international negotiations inch forward, there is mounting evidence that climate change is occurring faster than previously projected and with more disastrous effects. Alarmed by these developments, climate scientists are saying that, in order to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels, industrialized countries need to bring down their CO2 emissions 10 percent per year starting in 2014. As Kevin Anderson of the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research at the University of Manchester puts it, “We can still do 2 degrees Celsius but not the way we're going.” Scientists, environmentalists, and concerned citizens from the Global North and the South agree that progress made in Warsaw is “simply inadequate” given the scale and urgency of climate change. Binding commitments and real actions to reduce emissions at the source must be the foremost goal of negotiations. In fact, many have expressed dismay over the lack of urgency at Warsaw and ask why climate negotiators have not acclimated themselves to the fact that it is simply too late for incremental changes. The climate crisis and North-South disparities are results of a deeper crisis in corporate led economic growth. Privatization of resources and unsustainable technologies are contributing to environmental collapse and global inequities. The environmental organization Friends of Earth notes that governments of developed countries which are “deep in the pockets of corporate polluters... have prevented even minimal progress at the negotiations.” The COP19 Meeting in Warsaw was sponsored by a number of coal, oil and transportation corporations, such as Alstom Power, Arcelor-Mittal BMW Group Poland, Lotos Group, General Motors and Emirates Airlines.The Polish government also co-hosted a “clean coal” conference in Warsaw while the COP19 Meeting was taking place next door. Naturally, we ask: was COP19 meant to be just a “greenwashing exercise” for the coal and oil corporations involved? Given the lackluster results of the conference, did they truly intend to make significant progress in this area beyond a tepid show of support? The privatization and domination of nature calls for more deregulation of corporate activity and the commodification of the natural “commons.” Climate crisis, global inequalities, and resistance to necessary change all stem from the acceleration of competition over natural resources, especially energy. At the root of the crisis is the psychological dualism of “self vs. other” separating humans from nature and each other. A long term solution requires a shift to a partnership approach and a middle path of development that balances economic growth with sustainable technologies and equitable consumption. Worldwide efforts of youth, women, interfaith groups, and indigenous peoples to influence corporations, governments and the United Nations need much more support from global educational and media institutions."
ENTERTAINMENT,"Scarlett Johansson And Colin Jost Make Their Red Carpet Debut As A Couple","The “Avengers: Infinity War” premiere in Los Angeles on Monday night not only managed to gather every superhero in the universe, but also Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost. The actress and the “Saturday Night Live” star made their official red carpet debut as a couple at the event after nearly a year of dating. Johansson, who reprises her Black Widow role in the latest “Avengers” movie,  wore a silver metallic Erdem gown adorned with pearl accents with Jimmy Choo shoes and Messika jewelry. Jost opted for a black suit.  “I'm just excited to share this experience with him because I'm so excited to see the film. I haven't seen it before!” Johansson told Entertainment Tonight on the red carpet. The two were first spotted together in May 2017 when they were seen kissing at the after-party for the late-night sketch show's season finale. Months later, they confirmed the romance as they attended the American Museum of Natural History Gala in New York. Johansson announced her separation from French journalist Romain Dauriac in January of 2017. The couple share a 3-year-old daughter named Rose. Ahead of the red carpet, the actress stopped by “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” to promote the superhero flick ― and also note that her Black Widow character is set to get a solo film of her own. But the talk show host was, of course, more interested in her love life when she asked her to choose between Jost and his Weekend Update co-anchor, Michael Che. “No, it's not that hard to pick,” Johansson said with a smile. “I guess I'm a Colin fan, I have to say.” When Ellen showed her a throwback photo of Jost with a full-on beard, however, she seemed genuinely shocked about her beau's former look.“I can't say that that's an image that I'll ever forget,” she said. “I mean, I can't unsee it now. Oh my God, it is. Wow.”  Jost himself was a tad more effusive when asked about his relationship at the Emmy Awards in September. “She's wonderful,” he told “Entertainment Tonight. “She's pretty cool. It's hard to have a lot of complaints, she's pretty awesome. ... The first time she hosted [in January 2006] was the first year I was a writer on the show. So, we've kind of known each other since then. She's the best.”"
